A web app calculator created to practice front-end UI work. Created with vanilla javascript. It replicates a simple desk calculator.

The calculator displays at most 10 characters, plus a negative sign. In order to fit results on the display, numbers containing more than 10 characters (including a decimal point) will be rounded.

The percentage sign functions as an operator like the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division signs, taking the percentage of the following number. For example entering "10% 50"  returns "5", or ten percent of fifty.
